## Hello! Firebasse!

# Branches
I had separated the project into the several Branches to decide which function is needed for my project.
Now, I created the branch,"Setup" to initialize react and Firebase App.

Renewing Readme.md, I will renew the Develop branch definitely for uncomplementaly.
If Readme is collised, I simply renew develop branch and the readme in functionsFrame isn't merged.

Here the list.

:Master
The Production Frame, final phase.
If the app is setup and tested, finally I renew this branch.

:Develop
Main Developing branch.
If the function of the app is setup, finally I renew this branch.

--FunctionsFrame

:Setup
to initialize react and Firebase App.


--FunctionsFrame -> :Develop -> :Master
